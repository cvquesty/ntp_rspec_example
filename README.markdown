# ntp #

This module is a co-opting of a basic ntp module found elsewhere in my git repo.  I have added all the beaker, rspec, serverspec, etc. pieces, and this set of tests works without issue, testing 8 tests.  

I'm certain this could be improved, but the PL docs stink on this topic, and until they step up with that, it's whatever I can put together from trolling the web, so here it is.
